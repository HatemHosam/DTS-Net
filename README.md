# DTS-Net
DTS-Net is a deep-learning model based on Depth-to-space layer. It is used for semantic segmentation and the joint task of depth estimation and depth estimation.
The test code and the evaluation code on PASCAL VOC2012, NYUV2, and CITYSCAPES are provided with the corresponding weight file. 

requirements: <br />
Tensorflow '2.5.0' <br />
opencv '4.5.1' <br />
Numpy '1.19.5' <br />

NYU depth V2 groudtruth depth maps and semantic segmentation maps are saved in custom formats for easier use with the provided code, they are available at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1tviXcOM7ToxNjL1CbztsxVqs70l6adqY <br />
